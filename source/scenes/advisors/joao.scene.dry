= João Popodopolus

*In front of you there's a man sporting a typical Nurian mustache and a receding hairline. He has tired eyes, that of a man who cannot bear to look at the situation he inherited. His name is João Popodopolus and he is your Finance Minister.*

*João is a reformer, a rare breed in the ZRD, and a refugee from the 2nd Obrjoi War, something your father started and lost. You picked him to save the economy, he is not sure Parliament would want to do what's needed.*
